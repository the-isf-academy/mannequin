**0. Read the [`turtle` documentation on filling](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle#filling). To fill in a shape, you have to call `begin_fill()` before drawing the shape and `end_fill()` afterwards. All the shapes in `mannequin` are filled. Where are `begin_fill()` and `end_fill()` actually used?**

**2. What's the difference between the `settings` in `main.py` and the constants at the top of `body_parts.py`?**

**3. Let's imagine you wanted to move one of the constants at the top of `body_parts.py` (for example, `HEAD_COLOR`) into the settings in `main.py` instead. What steps would you have to take? (You can actually try this if you want.)**

**4. In `shapes.py`, there are three different functions for drawing a rectangle. Why?**

**5. The same function, `draw_arm`, is used to draw the back arm and the front arm. How does this work?**

**6. Similarly, `draw_leg` is used to draw the back leg and the front leg. The code for `draw_leg` and for `draw_arm` looks suspiciously similar. Can you think of a way to combine these functions? Would this be a good idea? (Yes and No are both reasonable answers--explain your preference.)**
