# Mannequin

Mannequin is a package that draws a stick-figure body. 

- Choosing which parts shoudl be confogurable. 
- Thinking in layers.

Questions: 
- I was able to reuse the same function to draw the back arm and the front arm. How does this work?
- I was also able to reuse the same function to draw the back leg and the front leg. The code for `draw_leg` 
  and for `draw_arm` looks suspiciously similar. Can you think of a way to combine these functions? Would this
  be a good idea? (Yes and No are both reasonable answers--explain your preference.)
- In `shapes`, there are three different functions for drawing a rectangle. Why?
